                <p>
                    The word "Forex" is derived from the words foreign exchange and is one of the names of the international currency market.  Forex is the largest financial market in the world, trading up to $4 trillion in turnover every day. This tremendous turnover is more than the combined volumes of the leading stock markets around the world on any given day. This trade volume creates a very liquid market that is desirable to trade in.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Unlike many other markets, Forex is a decentralized exchange with no central location in which transactions are cleared. It is primarily traded through banks, brokers, dealers, financial institutions and private individuals throughout the world.  And since these financial centers are located in different time zones, Forex is available to trade 24 hours per day.
                    Trades are executed through the Internet using trading platforms. The development of personal trading platforms and the smaller transaction costs caused a sudden increase in retail investors. With the advent of the Internet and growing competition it is now easily within the reach of most investors.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Just like other investment alternatives, foreign exchange offers traders/investors a market where they can buy or sell a specific currency pair. The currency pair may be the Euro versus the US Dollar, the US Dollar versus the Japanese Yen, the British Pound versus the US Dollar, the Euro versus British Pound, or a number of other currency combinations.
                    For active traders and investors, foreign exchange should be no different than other investment products such as equities, commodities or fixed-income. Because of globalization in the economic world and consolidation of whole economic regions (i.e., the European Union), including currencies in a portfolio helps to diversify assets and can reduce risk.

                <h3>The Liquid Currency Pairs</h3>
                Currencies, like equities and bonds, have pairs that are very liquid and those that are not so liquid. The liquid currencies are characterized by their country's stable economy and political system. Since the European currencies unified and created the euro, the currencies that are most liquid now include:
                <br/>US dollar
                <br/>Japanese yen
                <br/>British pound
                <br/>Euro
                <br/>Canadian dollar
                It is estimated that activities in these currencies comprise more than 80% of the daily foreign exchange volume.
                <h3>Foreign Currency Symbols</h3>
                Currencies have their own symbols that distinguish one from another. In Forex, the price of a currency pair is simply the value of one currency against the value of another. A currency pair includes the "name" for both currencies, separated by a "/". The "name" is a three letter acronym. The first two letters, in most cases, identify the country, while the last letter denotes the unit of currency for that country.
                For example, 
                <br/>USD = United States Dollar
                <br/>GBP = Great Britain Pound
                <br/>JPY = Japanese Yen
                <br/>CAD = Canadian Dollar
                <br/>CHF = Confederatio Helvetica (Latin for Swiss Confederation) Franc
                <br/>NZD = New Zealand Dollar
                <br/>AUD = Australian Dollar
                <br/>NOK = Norwegian Krona
                <br/>SEK = Swedish Krona
                Since the European Euro has no specific country attached to it, it goes simply by the acronym EUR.
                By combining one currency, EUR, with another USD, you create a currency pair EUR/USD.
                <h3>The Base and Counter Currency</h3>
                The Base Currency is the first currency in a pair. It is always the dominant currency in the pair. The Counter Currency is the second currency in a currency pair.
                <br/>
                The euro is the dominant base currency against all other global currencies. As a result, currency pairs against the EUR will be identified as EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, EUR/CHF, EUR/JPY, EUR/CAD, etc. The EUR acronym will always appear first in the sequence.
                <br/>
                The British Pound is next in the hierarchy of currency name domination. The major currency pairs versus the GBP would, therefore be identified as GBP/USD, GBP/CHF, GBP/JPY, GBP/CAD. Apart from the EUR/GBP, expect to see GBP as the first currency in a currency pair.
                <br/>
                The USD is the next dominant base currency. USD/CAD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF would be the normal currency pair convention for the major currencies. Since the EUR and the GBP are more dominant in terms of base currencies, the dollar is quoted as EUR/USD and GBP/USD.
                <br/>
                Knowing the base currency is important as it determines the values of currencies (notional or real) exchanged when a foreign exchange deal is transacted.
                <h3>The Value Of Currencies</h3>
                The base currency ALWAYS equals one of the currency's monetary unit of exchange (i.e., 1 euro, 1 pound, and 1 dollar). When an investor buys 100,000 EUR/USD, he is buying (or receiving) the Euro (the Base Currency) and selling (or paying for) the USD (the Counter Currency). The amount of the Base Currency he is buying is equal to 100,000 Euros.
                <br/>
                While the base currency remains a constant price, the counter currency will fluctuate with the exchange rate for the Currency Pair. It is equal to:
                (Amount of Base Currency x Market Foreign Exchange Rate)
                <br/>
                The smallest incremental change in a currency pair's price is called a "pip". In all pairs that exclude the JPY, a pip is equal to the fourth decimal value of a currency pair. Using leverage, traders can experience considerable gains or losses as price moves in fractions of a percent.
