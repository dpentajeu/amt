                <h3>What We Have to Offer</h3>
                <p>Clients who trade through AMT Market can take advantage of mobile trading, one-click order execution, and trading from real-time charts. However, the heart of our client offering is our <a href="#">No Dealing Desk</a> forex execution. Clients benefit from our large network of forex liquidity providers, which include global banks, financial institutions, prime brokers and other market makers, enabling us to offer <a href="#">competitive spreads</a> on major currency pairs. Serious traders expect their orders to be filled quickly, at the best price available, and nothing less. This is what AMT delivers. We fill your order at the best available price at the time the No Dealing Desk receives it. This price includes AMT's markup which may vary based on account type and liquidity provider.</p>
                <p>One of the advantages of our No Dealing Desk model is that we benefit from successful traders given that we make money on a per trade basis. For this reason, AMT focuses heavily on providing educational services to our clients to help them become better traders. AMT offers news and market research, on-demand educational videos, live instructor sessions, and ongoing trading support by the course instructors.</p>
                <h3>Investor Protection</h3>
                <p>AMT Market takes regulation and financial transparency very seriously, which also means that we meet strict financial standards, including capital adequacy requirements. As a vocal advocate of financial services regulation and increased investor protection, AMT's companies are registered with and regulated by some of the most respected regulatory bodies in the world. <a href="#">View AMT's Financials.</a></p>
