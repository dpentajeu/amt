                    <p class="note"><strong>Dealing Desk Disclaimer</strong><br>
                On the Dealing Desk execution model AMT can act as the dealer on some currency pairs. There are also back up liquidity providers that fill in whenever AMT does not act as the dealer. Please note that AMTâ€™s Dealing Desk employs fewer liquidity providers than the No Dealing Desk (NDD) execution option.  AMT does not guarantee that quotes, prices, or spreads will always be better on one form of execution as compared to the other.  Customers should consider many factors when deciding which execution type best suits their needs (e.g., conflict of interest, trading style or strategy, etc.).  For more information, see our <a href="/legal/trading-execution-risks/" onclick="s_objectID=&quot;http://www.fxcm.com/legal/trading-execution-risks/_1&quot;;return this.s_oc?this.s_oc(e):true">Execution Risks</a>.</p>
                    <p class="note"><strong>Advertised Spreads:</strong> AMT spreads are variable. The spreads listed here were derived from the time-weighted average of the spreads from April 7, 2013&nbsp;to April 19, 2013. Advertised spreads may not be applicable to client accounts of referring brokers. AMT strives to provide traders with tight, competitive spreads; however, there may be instances when market conditions cause spreads to widen beyond the spreads displayed here.

                    <p class="note"><strong>Compensation:</strong> When executing customers trades, AMT can be compensated in several ways, which include, but are not limited to: adding a mark-up to the spreads it receives from its liquidity providers, receiving compensation for order flow, and charging commission to accounts that trade with AMT's lowest spreads which are available to qualifying accounts. Under the Dealing Desk execution model, AMT may act as a dealer and may receive additional compensation from trading.
